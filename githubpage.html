                <h3>Job Comparison Application</h3>
                <p>
                    A student nearing graduation needs a tool to evaluate and compare multiple job offers, considering factors beyond just salary, such as benefits and location. To address this need, a straightforward, single-user job comparison application will be developed.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This app was created for the Android platform, adhering to a minimum API level of 28 (Android 9.0 Pie). 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Core Features:</strong>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Android SQLite Integration:</strong> Implemented Android SQLite for storing job details and comparison settings locally on the device. Application is successful in retaining both when reopening until the API is wiped clean.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>User Input with EditText:</strong> Use EditText elements to allow users to input job information details. CompareJobs Button is also disabled until 2 jobs are entered.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Custom Comparator:</strong> Developed a customized comparator class to facilitate the comparison of job offers based on user-defined weights.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Compare Job Selection:</strong> Users are able to select two job offers in the compare jobs page and view detailed information for both.
                </p>
